This is my 'professional' GitHub, aka "I can't rely on prior experience to get a job, so I have to prove I'm at least half-competent and worth training!"
If it shows up on here publically, it means I think it's at least decent enough to be seen by someone else.

That said, not all projects will be polished for legibility or efficiency. Projects in this account are primarily for personal use and/or learning experience.
